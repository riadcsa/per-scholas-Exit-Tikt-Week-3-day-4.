Exit Tikt Week 3 day 4.

Today we started by getting an introduction to IP networking  AWS VPC.  It is very important to select which VPC that fits your need. 
It help to know your workload, IP subnetting as well as networking security in order to run a well-functioning VPC in the AWS cloud. 
Also, Understanding and implementing Amazon VPC will facilitate the way  to fully use other AWS services.  
We went over the AWS structure and we were able to know that a VPC is located within an availability zone and AZ is located within a region. 
VPC can span AZs but not regions.  When creating an AWS VPC you cause the CIDR block between /16 to /28 and your IP addresses should not be overlapping. 
A VPC will need subnets Public or private or both, an internet gateway, routing tables, subnets security groups and an optional layer of security such as NACLs


AS AWS offers so many flexible opinion building a complete IT environment in the cloud, but it was a bit interesting to know that The address range of the VPC cannot be changed after the VPC is created .
I believe this is done for security and functionality reason that goes inline with AWS practices. 


Why ioT uses Ipv4 and not ipv6 considering
